Orchid consists of a core framework which provides the structure for extensibility, and numerous official\nplugins that give you the freedom to make your Orchid site perfectly unique. As Orchid is designed to replace Javadocs,\nJekyll, Gitbook, Hugo, and just about any other static site generator out there, many of these plugins are designed with\na content model that closely matches that of these other frameworks, but being a part of the larger Orchid ecosystem,\nprovides all benefits that come in addition to those models that the core Orchid frameworks gives us for free, while all\nbeing rendered in one single, beautiful theme.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<hr>"
