== Introduction

This text will give a brief overview of the different approaches to ensure trust
on a document. This document will not take any considerations on the level
of security provided by the described approaches. Especially since the approaches
have been invented during different times and infrastructures.


== Trust of a Document

Since the written word has been invented the need of really identify the source of the document has become urgent.
At the beginning link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_(emblem)[seals] has been used for that purpose.
Over the time different technologies envolved for sealing and signing paper based documents. Within
different countries also different technologies has been developed for the the digital document.


=== The closed system

As long as documents are only used within the same system the owner of the creator of the document
can be read out of the document metadata. Windows as an example is storing for each document,
which user has accessed it. So as long as the integrity of the system itself (and of course the administrator)
is not violated the information who has changed the document can be determined from the document metadata.
For organisations of course the system is becoming a whole network with many servers including mainframes.
The closed system approach usually applies for mainframes. Mainframe systems have a strong user seperation
and multi user management. So any document changes can be logged into an audit database. Especially the
action of "signing" a document.

=== The PKI-System (PKI - Public Key Infrastructure)

The PKI-System relies on asymmetric encryption. A document is signed by the private key of an key pair.
The ownership of the keypair itself is prooved by an third party . This proove itself is also a signed
document. This proove is also known as certificate.



The different usages of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure[PKIs]

* Certificate authorities
* Web of trust
* Blockchain-based PKI


== Ways of signing a Document

=== Embedded Signature

=== Detached Signature

=== Blockchain based Signature
