== Connector Architecture Overview

(Reference Setup)

The connectorSuite consists mainly 3 components:

* ConnectorClient
* Connector itself
* Domibus Gateway Connector Plugin


=== ConnectorClient / ConnectorClientLib / National System
Connector Client is the bridge between the national system or application and the connector. It is
 responsibly for mapping (if necessary) the international message to the national message. 

The connector client can call the service interface on the connector directly or can use the 
provided ConnectorClientLib. 

For further information read the connectorClient documentation.

=== Domibus Gateway Connector Plugin

The Gateway Plugin is installed as plugin at the Domibus Gateway and communicates with the connector 
over a webservice. 


=== Connector

The connector itself handles the transformation between the ASIC-S container and the generation of the 
evidences.
