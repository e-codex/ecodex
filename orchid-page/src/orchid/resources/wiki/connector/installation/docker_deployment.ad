DEPLOY WITH DOCKER
==================

For some users it might be interesting to deploy the domibus connector within an
container environment.

Currently there is no ready to use docker container deployed in any docker registry.
So you have to build the docker container by yourself. Since the connector is already
available as spring-boot application the workload of this is reduced to a minimum.
