This document should provide a brief overview of possible attack scenarios
on the e-Codex system.

Overview of the e-Codex Components

 * Country A
    ** Gateway
    ** Connector
 * Country B
    ** Gateway
    ** Connector
 * CMT
 * Certificate Authority


== Security Features

 * Messages are only transported between 2 Domains (no 3rd party can read or even
tell a message has been transported)
 * Decentralized infrastructure - one compromised node only affects communication with this node
 * Seperated infrastructures for certificate management and configuration management
 * The IP-Addresses of the partners are known


== Attacking e-Codex / e-Delivery

The following text would give a brief overview of angle of attacks at the whole e-Codex infrastructure.

=== Scenario 1 - Hijacking  an access point.

This is not really a design problem of e-Codex. Because the participants are
responsible for their own infrastructure and security. But the problem will only affect the communication
from and to this member state.

=== Scenario 2 - Hijacking the CMT

The CMT is responsible for distributing the configuration. The configuration contains all the used
certificates and IP-Adresses. So an evil party would have the possibility to modify the p-Modes and
certificates of an access-point and this would enable the evil party to intercept the data traffic.

In this example the CMT distributes a configuration where Party A and Party B would get an P-Mode
configuratoin and sets of certificates where a Party B' would act as an transparent proxy.

Party A <-> Party B' <-> Party B

This scenario is prevented by the usage of an 2nd party the Certificate Authority. All certificates
within the e-Codex domain must be issued by this CA. So it would be very hard for Party B' to
also get an valid e-Codex Certificate.

NOTE: An additional security feature would be if the configuration is signed by the party administrator
before it is going to be uploaded to the CMT.

=== Scenario 3 - Hijacking of the CA

If the CA is hijacked it would be possible for the attackers to issue valid e-Codex certificates. But
still the certificates must also be part of the distributed configuration so also the evil issued
certificates must become part of the by the CMT distributed configuration. So also the CMT
must be compromised.

== Conclusion

The effort to perform an man-in-the-middle attack would be high. Especially if the whole network should be
overtaken. In this case 2 seperate infrastructures must be captured. The CMT and the Certificate Authority.

Most likely is the sceneario that a single access point is attacked. To prevent this the access-points
should monitor the current by the CMT distributed configuration and check them against ther own current
configuration. Also the public available lists of issued certificates should be checked on a regulary
basis by the access-point administrator.


== Attacking an single Access-Point

Not only attacks on the whole network are possible. Also the single access-points can be valuable targets.
Currently the e-Codex network is by design public available (through the internet). This gives
the network a lot of flexibility but also makes it vulnerable to all kind of security threats.

=== IP Whitelist

As a first layer of hindering unpleasent guests the CMT is also distributing with the configuration
a list of IP-Addresses. So it is very easy task to simple block the traffic from all IP-Addresses which
are not within this Whitelist.

=== TLS Client authentication

The next level is the access to the gateway. The AS4 gateway is a simple Webservice. Within the e-Codex
network it is possible to enable certificate based TLS-Client authentication. So only clients which
do have a certificate signed by the RootCA and part of the distributed configuration are granted access
to the webservice.

=== TLS Encryption / Server Authentication

As TLS Client authentication is used also the webserver must be authenticated to the client. For this purpose
also certificates are used. This certificates also has to be signed by the RootCA. (Currently the
domibus gateway does not support that the webserver certificate itself has to exists in the trusted
webservers store).
The whole communication between the gateway and the webserver is TLS encrypted!

(TODO: define TLS level + at least used Algorithms - TLS1.3)

=== AS4 Message encryption

The over the opened HTTPs channel transported message has been signed and encrpyted by the sending gateway.
Also the gateway is doing a sender and recipient certificate validation. So a corrupt webserver will not be
sufficient to read the message content.

=== Connector Message signature

The over e-Delivery transported e-Codex messages and evidences are signed by the connector. So any modification
on the gateway or between the two connectors would be detected by receiving connector.
