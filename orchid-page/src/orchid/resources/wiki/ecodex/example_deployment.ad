== Components

.Table Components
|===
| Name  | Description

| Internet
| Symbolizes the Internet, The connection between the Gateways is made through it


| Firewall, DDOS-Filter
| A Firewall which protects the internal network. The information distributed over the CMT can be used to reduce the range of IP-Addresses which can connect through this firewall to the Apache Web Server

| Apache Web Server
| The Apache Web Server in this Setup is responsible for terminating the TLS-Connection, Authenticating the connecting Web-Clients (the remote Gateway) by checking the client certificate

| Tomcat Web Application Server - Domibus Gateway
| The domibus Gateway is deployed on a Tomcat Web Application Server

| Tomcat Web Application Server - Domibus Connector
| The domibusConnector is deployed on a Tomcat Web Application Server

| Tomcat Web Application Server - Connector Client Application
| The Connector Client Application is deployed on a Tomcat Web Application Server. This can be a national solution of an eCodeX-UseCase or the ReferenceImplementation.

| Database
| The database (MYSQL) provides for each application a different database.

 **Note that each application is running on it's own tomcat application server in this example!**


=== Firewall, DDOS-Filter

The firewall acts in this setup as simple IP-Filtering mechanism and ensures that only the partners of the ecodex-Network
can access the domibus gateway.


=== Example Apache Setup and alternatives

Possible alternatives for the apache in this use case can be:

 * NGINX
 * IIS 
 * Apache
 * Tomcat (using tomcat for TLS-terminiation)
 * ...

The most commonly used webserver is the apache webserver. http://httpd.apache.org/
Apache is well doucmented and there are a lot of examples. Important for the setup is that
the tls (at least TLS 1.2 better TLS 1.3) encryption is enabled on apache. For this purpose the
apache server needs a certificate. You can obtain this certificate also over letsencrypt.

As apache is the most used webserver over the whole internet the next paragraphs will cover the e-Codex
specifics of an apache setup.

==== Setting up Apache

The apache webserver project site offers a good tutorial for setting up apache with TLS-encryption.
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/ssl/ssl_howto.html

After the apache setup is complete make sure that your webserver is reachable over https from
the public internet. And also export the whole public certificate chain to the CMT to share
your public key information with your e-Codex network partners. This is very important if you
are using a not well trusted certificate authority or a self signed certificate.

Your shared webserver certificate will become part of the trusted_webserver.jks keystore - and
only certificates within this store are considered trusted in the specific e-Codex Environment.

==== Activating TLS-client-authentication/2-way-SSL on apache

Some e-Codex usecases may require also TLS-client authentication (aka 2-way-SSL). If the client authentication
is used also the client is authenticated at the server on TLS level. For this purpose the client presents
a client certificate to the webserver when opening the connection.

For activating 2-way-ssl on apache the following example configuration can be used. For further details
consult the apache manual!

```
<VirtualHost _default_:443>
  SSLEngine on
  ServerName localhost:443
  SSLCertificateFile "${SRVROOT}/conf/ssl/server.crt"
  SSLCertificateKeyFile "${SRVROOT}/conf/ssl/server.key"
  # The following Parameter holds all trusted client certificates (2)
  # (and thier parent certificates) in pem-format.
  SSLCACertificateFile "${SRVROOT}/conf/ssl/trusted_clients.pem"
  DocumentRoot "${SRVROOT}/htdocs"

	CustomLog "${SRVROOT}/logs/ssl_request.log %t %h %{SSL_PROTOCOL}x %{SSL_CIPHER}x \"%r\" %b"
	<Directory "${SRVROOT}/htdocs">
		Options Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks
		AllowOverride AuthConfig Limit FileInfo
        Require all granted
	</Directory>

  #always protect the whole v-host to avoid post-handshake authentication!
  SSLVerifyClient Require
  SSLVerifyDepth 2 # clientcert(0)->intermediateCA(1)->RootCA(2)

  <Location "/domibus/services/msh" >
    ProxyPass <gateway>/domibus/services/msh
    ProxyPassReverse <gateway>/domibus/services/msh
  </Location>

</virtualhost>
```

SSLVerifyDepth https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslverifydepth

NOTE: Put the SSLVerifyClient Require directive into the vhost directive to avoid SSL renegotiation. Though apache
supports the SSLVerifyClient also within a Location directive but this would force the client to renegotiate the
TLS connection. This can lead to connection errors at the as webclient acting domibus gateway.

==== Additional Notes on Webserver Setup

 * Ensure TLS 1.3 is activated and downgrading is not allowed!
 * Ensure that if the usecase requires it TLS-client authentication is activated


=== AS4 Gateway / Domibus Gateway

Most of the e-Codex installations are using the domibus gateway for fullfilling the AS4 interface. But there
are also known installations which are using IBM axway.

The eDelivery site of CEF lists some more alternatives:
https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eDelivery+AS4+conformant+solutions

Keep in mind that if you are using some of the alternatives you still have to fullfill the e-Codex protocol demands.
(TODO: link to technical differences ecodex - eDelivery)

==== Example Setup

For installing the domibus gateway the website provides a very good guide.
https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Domibus



==== TLS-client-authentication/2-way-SSL authentication


For clientauthentication the information is located under:

<domibus_tomcat>/conf/domibus/clientauthentication.xml

```$xml

<http-conf:tlsClientParameters disableCNCheck="true" secureSocketProtocol="TLSv1.2"
  xmlns:http-conf="http://cxf.apache.org/transports/http/configuration"
  xmlns:security="http://cxf.apache.org/configuration/security">

  <security:trustManagers>
    <!-- the following line contains the store which holds all trusted
    webserver certificates (file (b)) and thier parent certificates -->
    <security:keyStore type="JKS"
        password="changeit"
        file="${domibus.config.location}/keystores/trusted_https_servers.jks"
    />
  </security:trustManagers>
  <security:keyManagers keyPassword="12345">
  <!-- this key store contains the web client private key,
  the public certificate is distributed with
  the trusted_https_clients store  -->
    <security:keyStore
        type="JKS"
        password="12345"
        file="${domibus.config.location}/keystores/https_client_keystore.jks"
    />
  </security:keyManagers>
</http-conf:tlsClientParameters>

```

The same file is also used to list the trusted webservers the domibus gateway is connecting to. The
certifcates (and thier intermediate and RootCAs) of the trusted webservers are listed within
the trusted_https_servers.jks truststore.

To activate clientauthentication the gateway must present the webserver a key. This key is
stored in the https_client_keystore.jks. This key is private! The corresponding certificate is
distributed within the trusted_webclients.pem file and used at the webserver to allow the connection.

=== Setting up Connector

The additional features of the e-Codex protocol like

 * evidence handling
 * ASIC-S container building
 * TrustOK Token generatation

are provided by the domibusConnector. The domibus connector comes with an installation manual.

(TODO: set link to connector manual!)
